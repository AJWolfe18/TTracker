## 🧪 **Test Scenarios**

### Basic Filter Tests
1. **Category Filter**
   - Select a category → Only entries with that category should show
   - Switch tabs → Categories should update to match current tab data

2. **Date Range Filter**
   - Select "Last 7 days" → Only entries from past week should show
   - Select "Last 30 days" → Only entries from past month should show

3. **Sort Order**
   - Select "Oldest" → Entries should appear oldest first
   - Select "Newest" → Entries should appear newest first (default)

### Combined Filter Tests
1. **Search + Category**
   - Search for "trump" + Select a category → Should show entries matching both

2. **Date + Severity**
   - Select "Last 7 days" + "High" severity → Should show only recent high severity entries

3. **All Filters**
   - Apply all filters at once → Should show only entries matching all criteria

### Edge Cases
1. **No Results**
   - Apply filters that return no results → Should show "No entries match" message

2. **Clear All**
   - Apply multiple filters then click "Clear All" → All filters should reset

3. **Tab Switching**
   - Apply filters on Political tab → Switch to Executive → Filters should persist and apply

## 📝 **Implementation Notes**

### Key Functions Added:
- `applyAllFilters()` - Combines all filter logic in one place
- `handleFiltersChange()` - Debounced handler for filter updates
- `uniqueCategories` - Memoized extraction of categories from data

### State Variables Added:
- `selectedCategory` - Currently selected category filter
- `dateRange` - Currently selected date range
- `sortOrder` - Current sort order (newest/oldest)

### UI Components:
- Category dropdown
- Date range dropdown
- Sort order dropdown
- Severity dropdown (converted from buttons)
- Clear All button
- Active filters pills display

## ⚠️ **Known Limitations**
- Categories are extracted dynamically, so if no entries have categories, dropdown will be empty
- Date filtering uses simple date comparison, timezone not considered
- Filters are not persisted to localStorage yet (Phase 3)

## ✔️ **Ready for Testing**
The implementation is complete and ready for testing on the test environment.
All existing functionality has been preserved while adding the new filter capabilities.
