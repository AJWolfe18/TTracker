**Last Updated:** 2025-11-25

## Core Value Proposition

**"Win the Argument Arsenal"**

When you're in a conversation and need receipts on Trump's BS, quickly find and share bullet points of all the dumb shit he's done. TrumpyTracker isn't competing with news sites - it's a **searchable accountability database with attitude**.

---

## Target User

Progressive/liberal audience who:
- Gets into political arguments and needs quick facts
- Wants curated "bullshit receipts" with attitude
- Values spicy, opinionated summaries over neutral reporting
- Needs to find specific topics/actors fast during conversations

**User Job:** "I'm arguing with someone about Trump and need to quickly pull up what he actually did."

## Brand Voice Guidelines
