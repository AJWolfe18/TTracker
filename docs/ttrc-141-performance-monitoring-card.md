# TTRC-141: RSS Performance Optimization & Monitoring

**Epic**: RSS Ingestion System  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Story Points**: 5  
**Labels**: performance, monitoring, p2  

## User Story
As a **system administrator**, I need **optimized RSS processing and comprehensive monitoring** so that **the system scales efficiently and issues are detected proactively**.

## Background
Following P1 production fixes for TTRC-140, several performance and monitoring improvements were identified during QA review that should be addressed post-launch for optimal production operation.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Performance Optimizations
- [ ] **Parallel Article Processing**: Process RSS articles in batches instead of sequential loops
- [ ] **Connection Pooling**: Implement proper database connection pooling for worker processes  
- [ ] **Memory Management**: Add memory cleanup between RSS feed processing cycles
- [ ] **Batch Database Operations**: Group article inserts into batched transactions

### Monitoring & Observability  
- [ ] **Health Check Endpoint**: Add `/health` endpoint for load balancer checks
- [ ] **Metrics Dashboard**: Create operational dashboard showing key RSS metrics
- [ ] **Performance Monitoring**: Track processing times, memory usage, queue depths
- [ ] **Alert Configuration**: Set up automated alerts for critical thresholds

### Error Handling Enhancements
- [ ] **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Implement sophisticated circuit breaker with exponential backoff windows
- [ ] **Dead Letter Queue**: Add poison message handling for repeatedly failing jobs
- [ ] **Error Rate Monitoring**: Track and alert on job failure rates by type

## Technical Requirements

### Parallel Processing Implementation
```javascript
// Process articles in parallel batches of 10
const BATCH_SIZE = 10;
for (let i = 0; i < feed.items.length; i += BATCH_SIZE) {
  const batch = feed.items.slice(i, i + BATCH_SIZE);
  await Promise.allSettled(
    batch.map(item => processArticleItemAtomic(item, url, sourceName, db))
  );
}
```

### Health Check Endpoint
```javascript
// Add to Edge Function or worker
app.get('/health', async (req, res) => {
  const checks = {
    database: await checkDatabaseConnection(),
    queue_depth: await getJobQueueDepth(),
    memory_usage: process.memoryUsage().heapUsed / 1024 / 1024,
    last_feed_fetch: await getLastSuccessfulFetch()
  };
  
  const healthy = checks.queue_depth < 100 && 
                  checks.memory_usage < 500 &&
                  checks.last_feed_fetch < Date.now() - 3600000; // 1 hour
                  
  res.status(healthy ? 200 : 503).json(checks);
});
```

### Circuit Breaker Enhancement
```javascript
class AdvancedCircuitBreaker {
  constructor(failureThreshold = 5, resetTimeout = 60000) {
    this.failureCount = 0;
    this.failureThreshold = failureThreshold;
    this.resetTimeout = resetTimeout;
    this.state = 'CLOSED'; // CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN
    this.nextAttempt = Date.now();
  }
  
  async execute(operation) {
    if (this.state === 'OPEN') {
      if (Date.now() < this.nextAttempt) {
        throw new Error('Circuit breaker is OPEN');
      }
      this.state = 'HALF_OPEN';
    }
    
    try {
      const result = await operation();
      this.onSuccess();
      return result;
    } catch (error) {
      this.onFailure();
      throw error;
    }
  }
  
  onSuccess() {
    this.failureCount = 0;
    this.state = 'CLOSED';
  }
  
  onFailure() {
    this.failureCount++;
    if (this.failureCount >= this.failureThreshold) {
      this.state = 'OPEN';
      this.nextAttempt = Date.now() + (this.resetTimeout * Math.pow(2, this.failureCount - this.failureThreshold));
    }
  }
}
```

## Environment Variables
```bash
# Performance tuning
RSS_BATCH_SIZE=10                    # Articles processed in parallel
DB_CONNECTION_POOL_SIZE=5            # Database connection pool
MEMORY_CLEANUP_INTERVAL_MS=300000    # Memory cleanup frequency (5 min)

# Monitoring
HEALTH_CHECK_ENABLED=true
METRICS_RETENTION_DAYS=30
ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL=https://...

# Circuit breaker
CIRCUIT_BREAKER_FAILURE_THRESHOLD=5
CIRCUIT_BREAKER_RESET_TIMEOUT_MS=60000
CIRCUIT_BREAKER_MAX_TIMEOUT_MS=300000
```

## Definition of Done
- [ ] RSS processing performance improved by >50% with parallel article processing
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable over 24+ hour runs
- [ ] Health check endpoint responds reliably with system status
- [ ] Monitoring dashboard shows key metrics and trends
- [ ] Alerts fire correctly for queue backlog, memory issues, and feed failures
- [ ] Circuit breaker prevents cascade failures during external service outages
- [ ] Documentation updated with performance tuning guide

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Load test with 20+ RSS feeds and 1000+ articles
- [ ] Memory leak testing over 48-hour periods
- [ ] Circuit breaker testing with simulated failures
- [ ] Alert testing with threshold violations
- [ ] Health check integration with load balancer

## Implementation Notes
- **Deploy after**: TTRC-140 P1 fixes are stable in production
- **Monitor**: RSS ingestion rates and success metrics for 1 week before optimization
- **Rollback plan**: Feature flags for parallel processing and circuit breaker
- **Dependencies**: May require infrastructure changes for monitoring dashboard

## Estimated Impact
- **Performance**: 50-75% improvement in RSS processing speed
- **Reliability**: Reduced downtime from external service failures  
- **Operational**: Proactive issue detection vs reactive troubleshooting
- **Scalability**: Support for 50+ RSS feeds without performance degradation
