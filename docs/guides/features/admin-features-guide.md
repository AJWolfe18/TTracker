## Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Features Missing After Updates
**Prevention**: Always test for existing functionality before making changes
**Solution**: This update restored missing features with enhanced React implementation

### Issue: Test Workflows Not Running
**Solution**: Use manual dispatch from GitHub Actions UI
**Note**: Test workflows intentionally don't run automatically to save costs

## Technical Implementation

### Modal System
- Single adaptive modal component
- Dynamically shows/hides fields based on entry type
- Form validation ensures required fields
- Real-time saving to Supabase

### GitHub Integration
- Manual article processor uses repository_dispatch
- Requires GitHub PAT with repo permissions
- Triggers appropriate workflow based on environment

### Database Operations
- Uses SERVICE_ROLE_KEY for admin operations
- Maintains RLS policies for security
- Separate handling for political_entries and executive_orders tables
