## What Was Fixed

### 1. **data-test Attributes** (For Automation)
Added test hooks for Playwright/automation:
- `data-test="story-card"` on each story card
- `data-test="view-sources-btn"` on View Sources button
- `data-test="source-article"` on modal article links

### 2. **Tab Navigation ARIA Compliance** (Accessibility)
Complete WCAG 2.1 AA implementation:
- Container: `role="tablist"` + `aria-label="Content sections"`
- Tabs: `role="tab"` + `aria-selected` + `aria-controls` + proper tabIndex
- Panels: `role="tabpanel"` + `id` + `aria-labelledby`
- **Keyboard navigation**: Arrow Left/Right to switch tabs
- Screen reader friendly with proper focus management

### 3. **Modal ARIA Labels** (Accessibility)
- Added `aria-labelledby="sources-modal-title"` to modal dialog
- Added `id="sources-modal-title"` to h3 title
- Ensures screen readers announce modal purpose

### 4. **CSS Grid Breakpoints** (Already Correct)
Verified existing CSS matches spec:
- ≥1024px: 3 columns
- 768-1023px: 2 columns  
- <768px: 1 column
- No changes needed - already implemented correctly

### 5. **Documentation Comments**
Added critical inline documentation:
- Sort order explanation in `story-api.js` (deterministic ordering)
- Timezone handling note in `timeAgo()` function
- Helps future developers understand design decisions

---

## Risk Assessment

### 🟢 LOW RISK
All changes are:
- Additive (no removed functionality)
- Standard ARIA patterns
- Well-tested patterns from expert review
- Non-breaking enhancements

### Potential Issues:
1. **Tailwind color classes** - Dashboard-components uses `bg-${color}-600` which might not work with dynamic colors
   - **Fix**: If styles break, use inline styles instead
2. **Tab keyboard nav** - First implementation, may need tweaks
   - **Fix**: Easy to adjust key handlers based on feedback

---

## Testing Priorities

### P0 - Must Test Before Approval:
1. Tab navigation works (click + keyboard)
2. Modal opens/closes properly
3. Grid responsive at all breakpoints
4. No JavaScript errors in console

### P1 - Important:
5. ARIA attributes present (use browser inspector)
6. data-test attributes work (check with automation)
7. Sort order is stable
8. Timestamps show correctly

### P2 - Nice to Have:
9. Performance on slow 3G
10. Memory usage over time
11. Long text truncation
12. Edge case pagination (30, 31, <30 stories)

---

## Cost Impact
✅ **$0** - No new services, no API calls, pure frontend changes

---

## What's Still Pending (Option B - Polish Items)

These were **NOT included** in this commit (can be done later):

### Minor Enhancements:
1. **Live timestamp updates** - Timestamps don't refresh automatically (users refresh page anyway)
2. **Count badge behavior** - Unclear if should show "(0)" or be hidden initially
3. **Pagination edge case testing** - Need real-world testing with exact data
4. **Playwright test file** - Can be added after manual testing passes
5. **Performance monitoring** - Memory leak testing over extended sessions

### When to Do These:
- After initial QA testing passes
- During polish phase (TTRC-151)
- When preparing for production release
