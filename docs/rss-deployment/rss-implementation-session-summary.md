# RSS Implementation Session Summary - September 15, 2025

## What We Accomplished
- Successfully migrated TEST database for RSS system (created 6 new tables)
- Fixed TEST environment's political_entries.id INTEGER→TEXT type mismatch
- Implemented 4 Edge Functions API endpoints with cursor pagination
- Prepared production migration strategy

## Critical Knowledge for Future Sessions

### TEST vs PRODUCTION Database Differences
**TEST Environment Issues (FIXED):**
- Had `political_entries.id` as INTEGER (now TEXT with 'pe-' prefix)
- Required aggressive table recreation approach
- Has views that depend on political_entries

**PRODUCTION Environment:**
- Already has `political_entries.id` as TEXT ✅
- Use `001_rss_system_production.sql` for clean migration
- No table recreation needed, just additions

### Database Access
- TEST: `wnrjrywpcadwutfykflu.supabase.co`
- PROD: `osjbulmltfpcoldydexg.supabase.co`
- Both use Supabase SQL Editor (no psql needed)

### What's Ready
1. **Database:** All 6 tables created and verified in TEST
2. **Edge Functions:** 4 endpoints implemented, ready to deploy
3. **Test Data:** Loaded with 'test-' prefixed records

### Edge Functions Structure
```
supabase/functions/
├── _shared/          # Shared utilities (CORS, auth, pagination)
├── stories-active/   # GET active stories
├── stories-detail/   # GET story by ID  
├── stories-search/   # Search with filters
└── articles-manual/  # POST admin submission
```

### Key Technical Decisions
- **Cursor pagination only** - NO OFFSET anywhere
- **Postgres for everything** - No Redis needed
- **Edge Functions over Fastify** - Stays under $50/month
- **URL uniqueness** - Composite index (url_hash + date)

### Common Gotchas
1. Supabase SQL Editor doesn't support `\echo` commands
2. TEMP tables in DO blocks don't persist outside them
3. Views must be dropped before altering column types
4. TEST had schema mismatches requiring special handling

### Next Session Checklist
1. Deploy Edge Functions: `supabase functions deploy`
2. Set admin key: `supabase secrets set ADMIN_API_KEY=xxx`
3. Run `node test-edge-functions.js` to verify
4. Create automated tests (was skipped this session)
5. Implement job queue worker (TTRC-137)

### Files to Reference
- `/migrations/001_rss_system_production.sql` - For PROD deployment
- `/migrations/migration_verification_web.sql` - To verify migrations
- `/docs/production-deployment-checklist.md` - Step-by-step for PROD
- `/test-edge-functions.js` - Manual API testing

### What NOT to Do
- Don't merge TEST→MAIN (use cherry-pick)
- Don't run TEST migration scripts on PROD
- Don't use OFFSET in any queries
- Don't deploy without setting ADMIN_API_KEY

## Cost Impact
- Estimated: ~$30-36/month (mostly OpenAI API)
- Edge Functions: Within Supabase plan limits
- No additional infrastructure needed
