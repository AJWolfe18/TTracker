# Project Handoff - 2025-10-03 @ 9:30 PM - TTRC-189 Bug Fixes

## SESSION SUMMARY
Fixed critical clustering handler errors and schema mismatches discovered during post-implementation testing. TTRC-189 (Phase 1: Core Enrichment) is now fully stable and ready for Phase 2.

---

## WHAT GOT DONE

### Code Changes
**Branch:** test  
**Commit Message:** `fix: resolve clustering handler and schema mismatches in worker`  
**Files Changed:**
- `scripts/job-queue-worker.js` - Fixed clustering handler binding, schema mismatches in 5 locations

### Testing Status
- ✅ **Verified:** Enrichment working (story 44 enriched successfully, job 1020 completed)
- ✅ **Verified:** Clustering errors resolved (no more "Cannot read properties of undefined" errors)
- ✅ **Verified:** Cost tracking accurate ($0.000167 per story)
- ⏳ **Pending:** Frontend display of enrichment fields (Phase 5)

## UPDATES COMPLETED (Via Tools)

### JIRA
- **Updated:** TTRC-189 with post-testing bug fixes comment (5 fixes documented)

### Confluence
- No updates needed (implementation plan status unchanged)

### Documentation
- `/docs/handoffs/2025-10-03-ttrc-189-bug-fixes.md`: Session handoff created

## TECHNICAL CONTEXT

### Key Decisions Made
**Decision:** Keep `job_type` column name (not change to `type`)  
**Rationale:** Table has BOTH columns with identical data, but all indexes use `job_type` for performance  
**Alternatives Considered:** Code review suggested changing to `type`, but schema inspection showed indexes depend on `job_type`  
**Cost Impact:** No cost impact

### Issues Fixed
1. **Clustering Handler Binding** - Handlers were registered but not receiving supabase client
   - Fixed by wrapping in arrow functions: `(payload) => handler(payload, supabase)`
2. **Schema Mismatches** - Worker code used wrong column/field names:
   - `article.headline` → `article.title` (with excerpt fallback)
   - `spicy_summary` → `summary_spicy`
   - `neutral_summary` → `summary_neutral`
   - `created_at` → `first_seen_at` (maintenance functions)
3. **Model Name** - Inconsistent model naming:
   - `gpt-4-turbo-preview` → `gpt-4o-mini`

### Watch Out For
- **Frontend:** Enrichment fields (summary_neutral, summary_spicy, category, severity, primary_actor) are not yet displayed in UI
- **Database Query:** To see enriched stories, use SQL query or wait for Phase 5 frontend updates
- **Cost:** Enrichment is essentially free (~$0.0002-0.0004 per story with gpt-4o-mini)

## NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES

### Immediate Actions
1. **TTRC-190:** Phase 2 - Database Helpers (budget RPC, helper functions for enrichment queries)
2. **Test More Stories:** Run enrichment on additional stories to verify stability
3. **Frontend Preview:** Quick check of enriched stories in database (SQL query)

### Questions for Josh
- **Decision Required:** Should we proceed with Phase 2 (database helpers + backfill) or Phase 5 (frontend display) first?
- **Timeline:** When do you want to run the $0.03 backfill for 82 stories?

## ENVIRONMENT STATUS

**TEST Environment:**
- Status: Deployed and Stable ✅
- URL: https://test--taupe-capybara-0ff2ed.netlify.app/
- Notes: Worker running successfully, enrichment and clustering both operational

**PROD Environment:**
- Status: Stable (no enrichment deployed yet)
- URL: https://trumpytracker.com/
- Notes: No changes to prod

**Cost:** $35/month → unchanged (testing cost negligible)

**Database:**
- 84 active stories in TEST
- 2 stories enriched (43, 44) with all 5 fields
- No schema changes required
- Worker queue operational (0 pending jobs, 2 active)

---

## COMMIT READY

**Commit command for Josh:**
```bash
git add scripts/job-queue-worker.js
git commit -m "fix: resolve clustering handler and schema mismatches in worker

- Fix story.cluster handlers to receive supabase client (was causing 'Cannot read properties of undefined' errors)
- Fix article.headline → article.title in summarizeStory
- Fix summary field names: spicy_summary → summary_spicy, neutral_summary → summary_neutral
- Fix date fields: created_at → first_seen_at in maintenance functions
- Update model: gpt-4-turbo-preview → gpt-4o-mini for consistency
- All changes align worker code with actual database schema

Fixes clustering job failures and prepares for Phase 2 (TTRC-190)
Tested: Job 1020 enriched story 44 successfully"
git push origin test
```
