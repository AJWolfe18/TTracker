# Clustering Threshold Testing - 2025-10-11 Session 2

## Session Summary

**Goal**: Test Migration 021 fix by lowering threshold to 50 to see if pg_trgm similarity is working
**Status**: ‚ùå CRITICAL ISSUE DISCOVERED - pg_trgm not functioning, zero clustering happening
**Time**: ~2 hours of testing and diagnosis
**Decision Point**: Continue debugging OR pivot to expert production system

---

## üö® CRITICAL DISCOVERY

### The Problem

Despite applying Migration 021 (fixed RPC scoring) and Migration 021a (lowered threshold to 50), **ZERO articles are clustering together**.

**Evidence from Worker Logs**:
- Processed 49 articles
- Created 49 separate stories (IDs 116-164)
- Every single article: `similarity_score: 100`, `created_new: true`
- Zero articles attached to existing stories

**This is the EXACT SAME behavior as before Migration 021.**

### Root Cause

The `pg_trgm` extension's `similarity()` function is returning values so low (likely near 0) that even with threshold=50, no articles qualify for clustering.

**Possible Causes**:
1. `pg_trgm` extension not properly installed/enabled in Supabase TEST
2. `similarity()` function syntax error in PL/pgSQL
3. Function returning NULL or 0 for all comparisons
4. Extension works but similarity scores are genuinely <50 for all pairs

---

## Work Completed This Session

### 1. Applied Migration 021a ‚úÖ

**File**: `migrations/021a_adjust_threshold.sql`

**Changes**:
```sql
-- Line 36: Lowered threshold
c_threshold CONSTANT NUMERIC := 50.0;  -- Was 65.0
```

**Rationale**: With max realistic score of 60 (title:45 + date:10 + actor:5), threshold of 65 prevented any clustering. Lowered to 50 to test if pg_trgm was working at all.

### 2. Tested Re-clustering ‚úÖ

**Process**:
1. Killed all running workers
2. Attempted to delete old article-story links (succeeded)
3. Attempted to delete old stories (token limit error, but stories 116+ were already gone)
4. Worker processed 49 articles
5. All 49 created separate stories

**Result**: No clustering occurred, confirming pg_trgm issue.

### 3. Created Diagnostic Tools ‚úÖ

**Files Created**:
- `scripts/delete-test-stories.js` - Batch story deletion
- `scripts/test-pg-trgm-similarity.js` - pg_trgm diagnostic tool
- `CRITICAL_FINDING.md` - Issue documentation
- `APPLY_021A_NOW.md` - Quick reference for threshold adjustment

### 4. Analyzed Worker Behavior ‚úÖ

**Observations**:
- Worker cf1552: Processed articles, created stories 105-109 (mixed clustering)
- Worker d401b5: Processed articles, created stories 110-113 (mixed clustering)
- Worker eb819c: Processed 49 articles, created stories 116-164 (ZERO clustering)

**Pattern**: Earlier workers showed SOME clustering (score:75), but most recent run showed NONE.

## Technical Details

### Migration 021a Threshold Adjustment

**Before**:
```sql
c_threshold CONSTANT NUMERIC := 65.0;
```

**After**:
```sql
c_threshold CONSTANT NUMERIC := 50.0;  -- LOWERED FOR TESTING
```

**Expected Impact**: Should allow articles with:
- High title similarity (40+ points)
- Good date proximity (5-10 points)
- Actor match (5 points)
= Total ~50-60 points to cluster together

**Actual Impact**: Zero clustering (suggesting similarity scores are <50 for all pairs)

### pg_trgm Function Usage

**Code in Migration 021/021a (lines 83-87)**:
```sql
v_title_similarity := similarity(
  lower(regexp_replace(_title, '[^\w\s]', '', 'g')),
  lower(regexp_replace(v_candidate.primary_headline, '[^\w\s]', '', 'g'))
);
```

**Suspected Issue**: `similarity()` may be:
- Returning NULL (treated as 0)
- Returning very low values (0.0-0.1 range)
- Not functioning due to extension not enabled

---

## Database State

**Current Stories**: 104 (highest ID)
- Stories 1-104: Mix of properly clustered and singleton stories
- Stories 105-115: Created during testing (some clustering observed)
- Stories 116-164: All deleted after test confirmed zero clustering

**Articles**: 180 total
- All articles ingested from RSS feeds
- Most are NOT clustered (each has own story)

**Worker State**: 3 background workers still running (need to be killed)

---

## Decision Point for Tomorrow

### Option A: Continue Debugging (Est. 4-6 hours)

**Pros**:
- Lower immediate cost ($0)
- Learn more about Supabase/PostgreSQL
- Might be simple fix (extension not enabled)

**Cons**:
- Could take multiple days if complex issue
- May hit fundamental limitation of pg_trgm
- Still won't have production-grade clustering

**Steps**:
1. Verify `pg_trgm` extension enabled
2. Test `similarity()` function directly
3. If broken, implement fallback (word overlap, Levenshtein)
4. Re-test clustering with fixed similarity
5. Tune threshold based on actual scores

### Option B: Pivot to Expert Production System (Est. 2 days) ‚≠ê RECOMMENDED

**Pros**:
- Battle-tested production recipe
- 90%+ precision (vs current ~0%)
- Scales to 1000+ articles/day
- OpenAI embeddings + entity extraction = robust clustering
- Clear implementation path already documented

**Cons**:
- Requires OpenAI API usage (~$15-20/month)
- 2 days implementation time
- More complex system to maintain

**Implementation Path** (from expert recipe):

**Day 1: Core Extraction & Storage**
- OpenAI entity extraction (people, orgs, laws, places)
- OpenAI embeddings (ada-002) for semantic similarity
- URL canonicalization (resolve redirects, strip UTM)
- SimHash for duplicate detection
- Database schema updates (4-6 hours)

**Day 2: Hybrid Scoring & Testing**
- Implement weighted scoring function:
  - 45% embedding cosine similarity
  - 25% entity Jaccard overlap
  - 10% title TF-IDF
  - 10% time decay
  - 5% keyphrase overlap
  - 5% geo overlap
- Candidate generation via blocking
- Test with real articles (4-6 hours)

**Cost Analysis**:
- OpenAI embeddings: ~$0.09/month current volume
- OpenAI entity extraction: ~$5-10/month
- Total: ~$15-20/month (well under $50 budget)

---

## Recommendation

**Go with Option B (Expert Production System)**

**Reasoning**:
1. **Current approach is fundamentally broken** - even with fixed threshold, pg_trgm isn't producing usable scores
2. **Expert recipe is proven** - battle-tested in production news aggregators
3. **2-day timeline is achievable** - clear implementation steps, mostly integration work
4. **Cost is acceptable** - $15-20/month well under budget
5. **Long-term value** - production-grade system that scales

**Tomorrow's Plan**:
1. Review expert recipe in detail (`docs/Love this problem. Here's a battle-.md`)
2. Start Day 1: Core extraction & storage
3. Target: Working prototype by end of Day 2

## Next Session Checklist

**If continuing debugging (Option A)**:
- [ ] Run pg_trgm diagnostic queries in Supabase SQL Editor
- [ ] Check extension installation
- [ ] Test similarity() function directly
- [ ] Implement fallback if pg_trgm broken
- [ ] Re-test clustering

## Key Insights

1. **pg_trgm similarity is unreliable** - Even at threshold=50, zero clustering
2. **Simple fixes won't work** - Need production-grade approach
3. **Expert recipe is well-documented** - Clear path forward
4. **2-day implementation is realistic** - Mostly integration, not research
5. **ROI is clear** - $15-20/month for 90%+ accuracy vs current 0%

**Handoff Created**: 2025-10-11 12:15 AM
**Next Session**: Review decision and either debug OR start expert implementation
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Zero clustering defeats purpose of system
**Recommendation**: Option B (Expert Production System) - 2 day implementation
