# Project Handoff - October 2, 2025 - Docs Folder Reorganization

## SESSION SUMMARY
Completed full reorganization of `/docs/` folder from 50+ flat files into logical folder structure. Moved 40+ files into categorized subdirectories, archived 5 superseded versions, moved 17 temp files to deletion folder, and created navigation README. This will save 30-50K tokens per chat by removing handoffs from project knowledge.

## WHAT GOT DONE

### File Organization Changes
**Branch:** test  
**Files Changed:** 40+ files moved/created  

**Folders Created:**
- `/docs/handoffs/` - 7 historical session summaries
- `/docs/architecture/` - 5 system design docs
- `/docs/database/` - 7 schema/migration docs
- `/docs/guides/deployment/` - 3 deployment guides
- `/docs/guides/development/` - 3 development setup docs
- `/docs/guides/features/` - 4 feature implementation guides
- `/docs/guides/testing/` - 3 test documentation files
- `/docs/api/` - 2 API reference docs
- `/docs/reference/` - 3 quick reference docs
- `/docs/archive/` - 5 superseded versions
- `/docs/_temp_to_delete/` - 17 temporary files ready for deletion

**Files Created:**
- `/docs/README.md` - Navigation guide for entire docs folder

**Files Kept in Root:**
- Core protocol files (PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.md, STARTUP_PROMPT.md, SESSION_PROTOCOL.md, HANDOFF_PROMPT.md)
- migration-clarification.md (per Josh's request)
- QUESTIONS_ANSWERED.md
- DOCS_REORGANIZATION_PLAN.md (the plan itself)

### Testing Status
- ✅ **Verified:** All files moved successfully, folder structure matches plan
- ✅ **Verified:** README.md created with navigation links
- ⏳ **Pending:** Delete `_temp_to_delete/` folder (17 files inside)
- ⏳ **Pending:** Update project knowledge to remove handoff references
- ⏳ **Pending:** Verify no broken internal links in docs

### Confluence
- No Confluence updates needed (documentation-only changes)

### Documentation
- **Created:** `/docs/README.md` - Navigation guide for documentation
- **Reorganized:** 40+ files into logical folder structure
- **Archived:** 5 superseded document versions
- **Staged for deletion:** 17 temporary/duplicate files

## TECHNICAL CONTEXT

### Key Decisions Made
**Decision:** Keep `migration-clarification.md` in root folder  
**Rationale:** Josh requested it be kept for reference  
**Alternatives Considered:** Move to `/guides/deployment/` or delete  

**Decision:** Move temp files to `_temp_to_delete/` instead of direct deletion  
**Rationale:** MCP filesystem tools don't have delete function; this allows Josh to review before manual deletion  
**Cost Impact:** No cost impact (documentation only)

### Watch Out For
- **Gotcha:** The `_temp_to_delete/` folder needs manual deletion via Windows Explorer or git
- **Dependency:** Project knowledge should be updated to remove handoff document references (saves 30-50K tokens)
- **Risk:** None - all changes are file organization only, no code changes

---

## NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES

### Immediate Actions
1. **Manually delete:** `_temp_to_delete/` folder (17 files inside)
2. **Update project knowledge:** Remove handoff document references to save context tokens
3. **Optional:** Verify internal doc links aren't broken (low priority)

### Blocked/Waiting
- None

### Questions for Josh
- None - reorganization complete per plan
