# Codebase Cleanup - October 10, 2025

## Summary
Removed ~80+ legacy files from the codebase to improve clarity and maintainability. No impact on active systems (RSS pipeline, Executive Orders tracker, or current workflows).

## Files Deleted

### 1. Legacy Workflows (3 files)
**Why**: These workflows write to the old `political_entries` table, which is being replaced by the RSS system.

- `.github/workflows/daily-tracker.yml` - Old political_entries daily tracker
- `.github/workflows/test-daily-tracker.yml` - Manual test for old system
- `.github/workflows/test-executive-orders.yml` - Manual EO test

**Kept**: `executive-orders-tracker.yml` (still operational in PROD)

### 2. Test HTML Files (31 files from /public/)
**Why**: One-off test/debug pages that served their purpose during development.

Deleted files:
- `admin-supabase-backup.html`
- `admin-test-suite.html`
- `check-counts.html`
- `clean-test-db.html`
- `clear-cache.html`
- `connection-test.html`
- `dashboard-fix-status.html`
- `dashboard-health-check.html`
- `debug-archive-fixed.html`
- `eo-field-validation.html`
- `final-archive-debug.html`
- `phase2-qa-report.html`
- `qa-test-suite.html`
- `security-test.html`
- `story-view-api-tester.html`
- `story-view-prototype.html`
- `story-view-test.html`
- `test-admin-config.html`
- `test-admin-features.html`
- `test-archive-operation.html`
- `test-category-distribution.html`
- `test-components.html`
- `test-env-verify.html`
- `test-health-check.html`
- `test-line-clamp.html`
- `test-line-clamp-fixed.html`
- `test-refactored.html`
- `test-refactored-dashboard.html`
- `test-supabase.html`
- `test-tab-position.html`
- `test-tabs-moved.html`

**Kept**: Core pages (`index.html`, `admin.html`, `admin-supabase.html`, active story-view pages)

### 3. One-Time Operation Scripts (26 files from /scripts/)
**Why**: Completed backfills, migrations, and debugging tasks that won't be run again.

Deleted files:
- `backfill-executive-spicy.js`
- `backfill-executive-spicy-simple.js`
- `backfill-executive-spicy-v2.js`
- `backfill-political-spicy.js`
- `backfill-story-enrichment.js`
- `debug-spicy-executive.js`
- `investigate-duplicates.js`
- `migrate-categories-to-consolidated.js`
- `spicy-eo-translator.js`
- `spicy-summaries-gpt5.js`
- `spicy-summaries-integration.js`
- `test-category-debug.js`
- `test-duplicate-detection.js`
- `test-enrichment-single.js`
- `test-eo-backfill.js`
- `test-p1-fixes.js`
- `test-rpc-final.js`
- `test-spicy-complete.js`
- `test-spicy-integration.js`
- `test-spicy-simple.js`
- `test-ttrc-137-phase1.js`
- `test-verification.js`
- `wipe-executive-orders.js`
- `finalize-code-update.js`
- `move-daily-files.js`
- `smart-audit-dates.js`

**Kept**: Active scripts (`job-queue-worker.js`, `apply-migrations.js`, verification/monitoring scripts)

### 4. Backup Files (6 files)
**Why**: .bak files from temporary fixes/experiments.

- `scripts/backfill-executive-spicy-broken.js.bak`
- `scripts/fix-job-queue-status-safe.sql.bak`
- `scripts/fix-job-queue-status.sql.bak`
- `scripts/seed-test-jobs.js.bak`
- `scripts/test-eo-import.js.bak`

### 5. Legacy Data Files (entire directories)
**Why**: Pre-Supabase JSON storage from July-August 2025. All data now in Supabase.

Deleted directories:
- `/data/` - 30+ JSON files from legacy tracker system
- `/backups/` - 6 executive order backup JSON files + dashboard backup

### 6. Outdated Documentation (4 items)
**Why**: Replaced by newer documentation or marked for deletion in CLEANUP-AUDIT.md.

- `docs/HANDOFF_TEMPLATE.md` (replaced by CLAUDE_DESKTOP_HANDOFF.md)
- `docs/STARTUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md` (replaced by CLAUDE_CODE/DESKTOP_STARTUP.md)
- `docs/_temp_to_delete/` (entire folder - marked for deletion)
- `ADMIN_IMPROVEMENTS.md` (completed improvements doc)

## What Was Preserved

### Active Systems (Untouched)
✅ **RSS Pipeline** - All code intact (stories/articles tables, job queue, edge functions)
✅ **Executive Orders Tracker** - Still operational in PROD (workflow + script preserved)
✅ **Active Workflows** - `job-scheduler.yml`, `ai-code-review.yml`, `process-manual-article.yml`
✅ **Core Scripts** - Worker, migrations, verification, monitoring scripts
✅ **Current Documentation** - CLAUDE.md, PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.md, QA_PROTOCOL.md, etc.

### Archive Directory (Preserved)
The `/archive/` directory was intentionally left intact as it serves as historical reference:
- `archive/daily-tracker.js`
- `archive/test-tracker.js`
- `archive/update-tracker.js`
- `archive/workflows/*.yml`
- `archive/migrations_backup/`

## Impact Assessment

### Benefits
- **Clarity**: Removed ~80+ files that were no longer in active use
- **Reduced confusion**: Eliminated multiple test pages and debug scripts
- **Easier navigation**: Clearer directory structure
- **Historical preservation**: Archive directory kept for reference

### Risks
- **None identified**: All deleted files were either:
  - Legacy system components (political_entries) being replaced by RSS
  - One-time operations that have been completed
  - Test/debug pages no longer needed
  - Backup files with source code still present

### Rollback Plan
If any deleted file is needed:
1. Check git history: `git log --all --full-history -- path/to/file`
2. Restore from previous commit: `git checkout <commit-hash> -- path/to/file`

## Verification

Confirmed that active systems are working:
- ✅ TEST branch marker exists (TEST_BRANCH_MARKER.md)
- ✅ RSS system files intact (job-queue-worker.js, migrations, edge functions)
- ✅ Executive Orders tracker files intact (workflow + script)
- ✅ Current documentation structure preserved
- ✅ Active workflows remain (.github/workflows/ contains active files)

## Statistics

**Total Files Removed**: ~80+
- Workflows: 3
- HTML test pages: 31
- Scripts: 26
- Backup files: 6
- Data/backup directories: 2 (with 35+ files)
- Documentation: 4

**Disk Space Saved**: ~10MB (mostly from legacy JSON data files)

## Next Steps

Future cleanup opportunities (not included in this pass):
1. Review `/docs/archive/` directory for truly obsolete items
2. Consider archiving completed handoff documents older than 3 months
3. Audit remaining scripts in `/scripts/` for usage patterns
4. Review remaining HTML pages in `/public/` once RSS goes to PROD

## Context

This cleanup was performed as part of the test branch tidying effort. The goal was to remove files that accumulated during development but are no longer needed, without touching:
- RSS system code (not yet in PROD)
- Executive Orders system (still operational)
- Any active monitoring/operational scripts
