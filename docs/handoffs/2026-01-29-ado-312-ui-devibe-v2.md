# Handoff: ADO-312 UI De-Vibe (Continued)

**Date:** 2026-01-29
**ADO:** #312 - De-vibe UI: Remove AI aesthetic tells, implement B/W + stamp design
**State:** Active (in progress) - NOT YET COMMITTED

## What Was Done

### Core De-Vibe (Complete)
- CSS variables updated to B/W palette (light + dark)
- Removed gradients, blur, hover lifts, glows
- Severity badges converted to stamp style (border, no fill, rotation)
- Spicy badges (pardons) converted to stamp style
- JS color constants updated to gray

### Additional Fixes This Session
- Increased contrast for light mode (text, badges darker)
- Fixed re-offended stat visibility (was using transparent color)
- Removed dot separator between category/date on pardons
- Fixed localhost to use TEST database
- Adjusted severity badge spacing (4px top, 12px bottom)
- Modal width increased to 900px

## Next Session

```
Resume ADO-312: Test and commit de-vibe changes.

1. Read handoff: docs/handoffs/2026-01-29-ado-312-ui-devibe-v2.md
2. Start local server: npm run server
3. Test all pages in both themes:
   - http://localhost:8000/ (Stories)
   - http://localhost:8000/executive-orders.html
   - http://localhost:8000/pardons.html
4. If contrast is acceptable, run code review and commit
5. Push to test branch
6. Update ADO-312 to Testing
7. Optionally start ADO-314 (UI polish items)
```

## Notes

- SCOTUS page doesn't exist yet (no scotus.html) - separate feature
- User feedback: light mode was "too grey" - increased contrast this session
- All changes are on test branch, ready to commit when approved
