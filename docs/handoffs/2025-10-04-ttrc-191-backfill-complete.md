# Project Handoff - 2025-10-04 @ 9:15 PM - TTRC-191 Backfill Complete

## SESSION SUMMARY
Successfully executed Phase 3 backfill on TEST environment, enriching 73/84 stories (87% coverage). Validated enrichment quality and identified two critical improvements: budget tracking bug and RSS feed filtering need.

## WHAT GOT DONE

### Code Changes
**Branch:** test  
**Commit Message:** `feat: add story enrichment backfill script (TTRC-191)`  
**Files Changed:**
- `scripts/backfill-story-enrichment.js` - Backfill script with dry-run, batching, idempotency

### Testing Status
- ✅ **Verified:** Backfill script works (dry-run + real run tested)
- ✅ **Verified:** 73/84 stories enriched successfully (87% coverage)
- ✅ **Verified:** Summaries accurate and coherent (Josh spot-checked)
- ✅ **Verified:** Categories/severity working correctly
- ⚠️ **Issue:** Budget tracking RPC not called by worker (TTRC-195 created)
- ✅ **Expected:** 11 failures (stories with 0 articles - can't enrich)

## UPDATES COMPLETED (Via Tools)

### JIRA
- **Transitioned:** TTRC-191 from "Backlog" → "Done"
- **Updated:** TTRC-191 with results comment (86.9% coverage, 69 successful jobs, budget tracking issue)
- **Created:** TTRC-195 (Bug) - Worker not calling increment_budget RPC
- **Created:** TTRC-196 (Story) - Filter RSS stories to government/Trump-focused only

### Confluence
- No updates needed (implementation plan status unchanged)

### Documentation
- `/scripts/backfill-story-enrichment.js`: New backfill script with comprehensive docs

## TECHNICAL CONTEXT

### Key Decisions Made

**Decision:** Accept 11 failed jobs as expected behavior  
**Rationale:** These stories have 0 articles in article_story table - nothing to enrich from. They're likely test data artifacts ("Concurrent article 1", etc.)  
**Alternatives Considered:** Re-enqueue and retry (rejected - would fail again), delete stories (rejected - may fix themselves when articles added)  
**Cost Impact:** No cost impact

**Decision:** Create separate bug ticket for budget tracking  
**Rationale:** RPC exists and works, but worker code missing the call. Separate fix from backfill work.  
**Alternatives Considered:** Fix immediately (rejected - backfill already successful, budget fix can be done separately)  
**Cost Impact:** No immediate cost impact (costs still incurred, just not tracked)

**Decision:** Filter RSS feeds (TTRC-196) before production launch  
**Rationale:** Too much noise from non-government stories wastes enrichment costs and user attention  
**Alternatives Considered:** N/A - new requirement identified during testing  
**Cost Impact:** Will reduce costs by ~70% once implemented

### Watch Out For

- **Budget Tracking:** Worker completes enrichment but doesn't call increment_budget RPC. Costs are real but not tracked in database. Fix in TTRC-195.
- **Failed Stories:** 11 stories (IDs: 21-31) have no articles. Don't re-enqueue unless articles are added to them first.
- **Test Data:** Some stories in TEST are "Concurrent article X" test artifacts - these may not exist in PROD.

## NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES

### Immediate Actions
1. **TTRC-195:** Fix budget tracking - Add RPC call to worker after OpenAI enrichment succeeds
2. **TTRC-192:** Phase 4 - Auto-trigger enrichment when new stories created
3. **TTRC-193:** Phase 5 - Frontend display (show summaries in UI)

### Blocked/Waiting
- None - all dependencies met

### Questions for Josh
- **Priority:** Which first - TTRC-195 (budget fix) or TTRC-192 (Phase 4 auto-trigger)?
- **RSS Filtering (TTRC-196):** When to tackle? Before Phase 5 frontend or after?
- **Production Timing:** Apply Migration 019 to PROD now, or wait until Phase 4/5 complete?

## ENVIRONMENT STATUS

**TEST Environment:**
- Status: Deployed and Stable ✅
- URL: https://test--taupe-capybara-0ff2ed.netlify.app/
- Notes: 73 stories enriched, worker running successfully

**PROD Environment:**
- Status: Stable (no changes)
- URL: https://trumpytracker.com/
- Notes: Migration 019 not applied yet (waiting for Phase 4/5 completion)

**Cost:** $35/month → unchanged (TEST enrichment ~$0.03 one-time cost)

**Database:**
- Migration 019 applied to TEST (indexes + RPC)
- 73/84 stories have summary_spicy, category, severity
- Budget tracking exists but not being used by worker
