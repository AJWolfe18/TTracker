# TTRC-61 & TTRC-62 Planning Session - Handoff
**Date:** 2025-10-10
**Session Context:** Strategic planning review of TTRC-61 & TTRC-62
**Status:** Planning complete, ready for implementation approval
**Related JIRA:** TTRC-61 (Enhanced Story Detail), TTRC-62 (Article Field Enhancement)

---

## Executive Summary

Reviewed and refined the implementation plan for TTRC-61 (Editorial Summary System) and TTRC-62 (Article Field Enhancement). Original vision was ambitious but risked budget overruns and user cognitive overload. **New approach is leaner, more actionable, and stays within budget.**

**Key Changes:**
- ‚úÖ Simplified 5-part editorial structure ‚Üí 3-part actionable structure
- ‚úÖ Added smart tiered action system (Direct/Systemic/Tracking)
- ‚úÖ Reduced scope to high-value metadata (regional tags + policy areas)
- ‚úÖ Deferred relationship mapping until data supports it
- ‚úÖ Combined cost: ~$43-45/month (within $50 budget)

---

## Problem Statement

### Original TTRC-61 Vision (Too Ambitious)
**5-part editorial structure:**
1. "What They Say" - Official narrative
2. "What It Really Means" - Plain English translation
3. "Reality Check" - Fact verification
4. "Why This Matters" - Implications
5. "What's Not Being Said" - Missing context

**Issues:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è ~$55-60/month (exceeds $50 budget)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 5 sections = cognitive overload for users
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Redundancy between sections
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Harder to get consistent AI output (more fields = more validation needed)

### Original TTRC-62 Scope (Unclear Priorities)
**Everything at once:**
- Regional tags
- Policy areas
- Enhanced categorization
- Article relationship mapping
- Source credibility scoring

**Issues:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No prioritization = unclear what to build first
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Relationship mapping = high complexity, uncertain ROI
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some features redundant with existing capabilities

---

## Refined Solution

### TTRC-61: Enhanced Story Detail System

**3-Part Structure (Cards open to `/story/:id`):**

1. **Spicy Summary** ‚úÖ (Already working)
   - Editorial "raise eyebrows" take
   - Current system is solid

2. **What It Really Means** üÜï
   - Plain English breakdown: "Here's why we're fucked"
   - Real-world impact on regular people
   - Cuts through euphemisms
   - Example: "Border security facility" ‚Üí "Concentration camp designed to terrorize families"

3. **How We Fight Back** üÜï (Smart Tiered System)
   - **Tier 1: Direct Action** (~30% of stories)
     - Specific orgs, events, deadlines
     - Example: RAICES bond fund, protest on Oct 15
   - **Tier 2: Systemic/Long-term** (~50% of stories)
     - Building power structures, supporting infrastructure
     - Example: Fund investigative journalism, primary challenges
   - **Tier 3: Tracking Only** (~20% of stories)
     - No action section when nothing actionable
     - Preserves credibility vs forcing fake actions

**Why This Works Better:**
- ‚úÖ **User value:** Turns outrage into action (unique differentiator)
- ‚úÖ **Avoids fatigue:** Tiered system prevents generic "call your reps" repetition
- ‚úÖ **Cost-effective:** ~$45/month vs ~$60/month with 5 parts
- ‚úÖ **Digestible:** 3 sections vs 5 (not overwhelming)

**Quality Control:**
- AI must rate action quality 7+/10 or default to systemic tier
- Must have 2+ SPECIFIC actions (not generic)
- Avoids "call your reps" unless specific bill/deadline included

---

### TTRC-62: Article Field Enhancement

**Priority 1: MVP+ Metadata (Implement Now)**

1. **Regional Tags**
   - Examples: `["Texas", "Border States", "National"]`
   - Use: Filter by location, regional impact analysis
   - Cost: +$0.0001/story

2. **Policy Areas**
   - Examples: `["Immigration", "Civil Rights", "Healthcare"]`
   - Use: Cross-category analysis, topical filtering
   - Cost: +$0.0001/story

**Priority 2: Deferred Until Data Supports**

3. **Article Relationship Mapping**
   - Reason: High complexity, uncertain ROI
   - Re-evaluate: After 6 months of user behavior data

4. **Timeline Correlation**
   - Reason: Requires mature dataset (500+ stories)
   - Re-evaluate: When corpus reaches critical mass

**Out of Scope:**
- ~~Source credibility scoring~~ (too complex, unclear benefit)
- ~~Key point extraction~~ (summaries already cover this)

---

## Cost Analysis

### Combined TTRC-61 + TTRC-62 Impact

| Component | Tokens | Cost/Story | Monthly (125 stories) |
|-----------|--------|------------|----------------------|
| Current (2 summaries) | ~500 | $0.0004 | ~$40 |
| + What It Means | ~200 | +$0.0001 | +$1 |
| + Action Section | ~300 | +$0.0002 | +$2 |
| + Regional tags | ~50 | +$0.0001 | +$1 |
| + Policy areas | ~50 | +$0.0001 | +$1 |
| **Total** | **~1100** | **~$0.0008** | **~$43-45** |

**‚úÖ Within $50 budget with ~10% buffer**

**One-time backfill:** ~$0.08 (84 stories)

---

## Technical Architecture

### Database Schema Changes

```sql
-- TTRC-61 additions to stories table:
ALTER TABLE stories ADD COLUMN summary_what_it_means TEXT;
ALTER TABLE stories ADD COLUMN action_tier TEXT CHECK (action_tier IN ('direct', 'systemic', 'tracking'));
ALTER TABLE stories ADD COLUMN action_section JSONB;

-- TTRC-62 additions to stories table:
ALTER TABLE stories ADD COLUMN regions TEXT[];
ALTER TABLE stories ADD COLUMN policy_areas TEXT[];

-- Indexes for filtering:
CREATE INDEX idx_stories_regions ON stories USING GIN (regions);
CREATE INDEX idx_stories_policy_areas ON stories USING GIN (policy_areas);
```

### Enrichment Prompt Output

```javascript
{
  // Existing fields (TTRC-189):
  "summary_neutral": "...",
  "summary_spicy": "...",
  "category": "...",
  "severity": "...",
  "primary_actor": "...",
  
  // New TTRC-61 fields:
  "summary_what_it_means": "Plain English breakdown...",
  "action_tier": "direct" | "systemic" | "tracking",
  "action_confidence": 8, // 0-10 quality score
  "action_reasoning": "Why this tier was chosen",

        "description": "Specific action text with details",
        "specificity": 9, // 0-10 how specific vs generic
        "url": "https://...",
        "deadline": "2025-10-15"
      }
    ]
  },
  
  // New TTRC-62 fields:
  "regions": ["Texas", "Border States"],
  "policy_areas": ["Immigration", "Civil Rights"]
}
```

- Effort: 4-5 hours

**Phase 2 Prerequisites:**
- ‚è≥ Phase 1 engagement metrics meet targets
- ‚è≥ Moderation bandwidth available
- ‚è≥ Community size large enough for upvotes to be meaningful

---

## Decision Framework: When to Apply Action Tiers

### Tier 1: Direct Action (Use "What We Can Do")
**Characteristics:**
- Specific org doing the work (not generic "ACLU")
- Concrete event or deadline
- Boycott/support specific company
- Example: "Donate to RAICES Texas bond fund" + link + "Rally at Dallas ICE office Oct 15, 2pm"

**When to Use:**
- Ongoing harm (detention, deportations)
- Clear advocacy org working on this specific issue
- Legislative intervention still possible
- Local action available (protests, community support)
- Clear target (senator up for re-election, company to boycott)

---

### Tier 2: Systemic/Long-term (Use "How We Fight Back")
**Characteristics:**
- Building infrastructure (journalism, legal aid, organizing)
- Voter registration, primary challenges
- Support watchdog organizations
- Reframed as "this harm + how we prevent next one"
- Example: "This pardon can't be reversed, but here's how we prevent the next one: vote in 2026 primaries, support accountability journalism"

**When to Use:**
- Damage already done (pardons, appointments confirmed)
- Systemic problem where individual action feels abstract
- National security / foreign policy (user has zero leverage on specific decision)
- No clear org working on THIS specific issue (but can support general infrastructure)

---

### Tier 3: Tracking Only (Omit Action Section)
**Characteristics:**
- Pure statement, tweet, or symbolic act
- No clear actions, no clear organizations
- Would require generic "stay informed" platitudes
- Better to omit than give weak suggestions

**When to Use:**
- Query would result in <2 specific actions
- Only generic suggestions possible ("call your reps" without specifics)
- Confidence score <7/10

---

## Scenario Testing Examples

### Scenario 1: Immigration Detention (Tier 1 ‚úÖ)
**Story:** "New Border Facility Opens in Texas"

**What It Means:**
This facility is designed to process mass deportations and hold families indefinitely. The "deterrent" isn't security - it's cruelty.

**What We Can Do:**
- Call your reps (202-224-3121): Demand they visit the facility
- Support RAICES Texas: Direct legal aid for families
- Donate to bond funds: Help families get released while awaiting hearings
- Attend local protest: Dallas ICE office, Oct 15, 2pm [link]

**Why Tier 1:** Specific orgs, specific events, ongoing harm, clear actions.

---

### Scenario 2: Trump Pardons Jan 6 Rioters (Tier 2 ‚ö†Ô∏è)
**Story:** "Trump Pardons 150 January 6th Defendants"

**What It Means:**
This isn't mercy - it's a message. He's telling supporters that violence in his name will be protected. It undermines the judicial process and signals laws don't apply to his movement.

**How We Fight Back:**
This pardon is done, but we can prevent the next one:
- Contact senators: Demand pardon limitation legislation
- Support Capitol Police: Share their testimony
- Vote in 2026 primaries: Challenge senators who stayed silent
- Fund accountability journalism: ProPublica, similar outlets

**Why Tier 2:** Pardons already issued (can't reverse), so reframe as long-term power building.

---

### Scenario 3: Crypto Donor to Treasury (Tier 3 ‚ùå)
**Story:** "Major Cryptocurrency Donor Named Treasury Secretary"

**What It Means:**
This isn't about qualifications - it's payback. The donor gave millions and now gets to write regulations that could kill his investigation and enrich his crypto portfolio.

**No Action Section** (Tier 3: Tracking Only)

**Why Tier 3:** Once appointed, realistic answer is "not much you can do." Forcing generic actions damages credibility. Story still valuable for tracking corruption.

---

## Success Metrics

### User Engagement (Measure Phase 1)
- Click-through rate on action items (target: >15%)
- Time spent on story detail pages (target: >2 min avg)
- Social shares from story pages (track growth)
- Return visits (users checking action progress)

### Content Quality (QA Phase 1)
- Action specificity scores (target: avg 8+/10)
- Tier distribution matches expectations (30% direct, 50% systemic, 20% tracking)
- Reduced generic action repetition (<10% "call your reps" without specifics)
- User feedback: "helpful" vs "not helpful" votes

### Business Impact (Measure After 3-6 Months)
- Growing activist community (if Phase 2 implemented)
- Media citations of TrumpyTracker mobilization efforts
- Demonstrable real-world action conversions (track via partner orgs if possible)
- Increased engagement vs old 2-summary system

---

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Generic "call your reps" repetition | User fatigue, reduced engagement | Medium | Quality threshold + tier system + manual review |
| AI suggests unsafe/ineffective actions | User harm, platform credibility | Low | Specificity scoring (7+/10) + manual spot checks |
| Action URLs go dead over time | Poor UX, broken links | Medium | Periodic link validation (quarterly) |
| Cost overruns from complex prompts | Budget breach | Low | Token limits + fallback to systemic tier |
| Tier distribution off (too much Tier 3) | Looks like we gave up on actions | Low | Monitor distribution, adjust prompt if needed |
| Community spam/trolling (Phase 2) | Platform credibility | Medium | Moderation queue + upvote threshold |

---

## Decision Points & Approvals Needed

### Before Phase 1 Implementation:
- ‚úÖ Confirm 3-section structure (Spicy + What It Means + Actions) **[APPROVED]**
- ‚úÖ Approve tiered action system (Direct/Systemic/Tracking) **[APPROVED]**
- ‚úÖ Accept ~$45/month cost (~10% budget increase) **[APPROVED]**
- ‚è≥ Review sample enrichment outputs for quality **[PENDING]**

### Before Phase 2 Implementation:
- ‚è≥ Validate Phase 1 engagement metrics meet targets
- ‚è≥ Confirm moderation bandwidth available
- ‚è≥ Assess community size (need critical mass for upvoting to work)

---

## What Changed from Original Vision

### TTRC-61 Changes:

**Removed:**
- "What They Say" section (redundant with good spicy summary)
- "Reality Check" section (covered by "What It Means")
- "Why This Matters" section (implicit in action framing)
- "What's Not Being Said" section (addressed in "What It Means")

**Added:**
- Tiered action system (prevents generic repetition)
- Quality threshold (7+/10 or fallback to systemic)
- Crowdsource path for Phase 2 (community involvement)

**Why:**
- 5 parts = cognitive overload + budget issues
- 3 parts = digestible + action-oriented + within budget
- Tiered system solves "what to do when there's nothing to do" problem

---

### TTRC-62 Changes:

**Removed:**
- Source credibility scoring (too complex, unclear benefit)
- Immediate relationship mapping (defer until data supports)
- Key point extraction (summaries already do this)

**Added:**
- Clear prioritization (MVP+ now, advanced features later)
- Integration with TTRC-61 (avoid duplicating enrichment work)
- Specific re-evaluation criteria for deferred features

**Why:**
- Regional tags + policy areas = high value, low complexity
- Relationship mapping = high complexity, uncertain ROI
- Better to prove value of simple features before adding complex ones

---

## Open Questions for Next Session

### Implementation Details:
1. **Sample Enrichment Output:** Should we generate 3-5 sample outputs with real stories to validate prompt quality before backfilling all 84?
2. **Manual Review:** Do you want to manually approve the first 10-20 enriched stories before auto-running the rest?
3. **Action URL Validation:** Should we build automated link checking into the backfill process?

### UX Questions:
4. **Region Filter:** Dropdown or pills? (dropdown = cleaner, pills = faster)
5. **Story Detail Page:** Should "Sources" expand inline or stay as modal?
6. **Share Buttons:** Which platforms? (Twitter/X, Facebook, email, copy link?)

### Phase 2 Timing:
7. **Community Features:** How long should we run Phase 1 before deciding on Phase 2? (suggest: 3 months minimum)
8. **Moderation:** Who reviews suggested actions? You only, or can we build an approval workflow?
