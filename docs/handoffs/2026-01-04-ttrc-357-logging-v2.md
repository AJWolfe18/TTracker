**Date:** 2026-01-04
**Branch:** test
**Commit:** 36e0f58

## What Was Done

### 1. Logging Improvements (Committed)
Enhanced ARTICLE_DECISION logs to v0.2 schema:
- Added `article_title` (truncated to 80 chars)
- Added `best_story_headline` (truncated to 80 chars)
- Added `blockers` array for created decisions (null for attached)
- Controlled by `INCLUDE_TITLES_IN_LOGS` env var (default: true)

**File changed:** `scripts/rss/hybrid-clustering.js`

### 2. JIRA Tickets Created
- **TTRC-358:** Mega-story clustering for breaking news (parent: TTRC-225)
- **TTRC-359:** Content relevance filtering at RSS ingestion

### 3. RSS Run Analysis (19:49 UTC)
| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Attached | 4 |
| Created | 3 |
| Correct merges | 4 |
| Correct separations | 1 |
| Borderline | 1 |
| Fragmentation (MARGIN) | 1 |

**Key finding:** One Venezuela article blocked by MARGIN (0.006) despite entity corroboration. Decision: Leave MARGIN alone for now.

## TTRC-336 Shadow Status

| Run | Date | Result |
|-----|------|--------|
| 1 | Jan 2 | Clean |

## Pending JIRA Updates

### TTRC-336 (Batch Dedup)
Add comment:
> Shadow run #3 clean (2026-01-04 19:49 UTC). 2 rejects, no false positives. 2 more clean runs needed before going live.

### TTRC-357 (Canonical Logs)
Status should already be Done. If not, transition to Done.
Add comment:
> v0.2 schema deployed (commit 36e0f58). Adds article_title, best_story_headline, blockers fields.

---

## Next Steps

1. Run 2 more RSS tests with `log_canonical=true` to complete TTRC-336 validation
2. After 5 clean shadow runs, flip `BATCH_DEDUP_SHADOW_MODE=false`
3. TTRC-358/359 are backlog items for later prioritization
