# 2026-01-26: ADO-305/306 SCOTUS Label Alignment & QA Planning

## Session Summary

Implemented label-to-outcome guidance (ADO-305) and set up Phase 2 QA card (ADO-306).

## Commits
```
50c5935 feat(ado-305): add explicit label-to-outcome alignment guidance to Pass 2 prompt
15c9e22 fix(ado-305): clarify systemic impact over individual case wins
```

## ADO Cards Updated

| Card | State | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| ADO-302 | Closed | Label/level consistency validated |
| ADO-304 | Closed | Phase 1 evaluation complete |
| ADO-270 | Ready for Prod | Stories tone system |
| ADO-271 | Ready for Prod | EO pipeline |
| ADO-305 | Testing | Label-to-outcome guidance implemented |
| ADO-306 | New | Phase 2 QA options documented |

## ADO-305 Validation Results

15-case re-enrichment batch:
- **13/14 correct alignment** (~93%)
- **1 mismatch**: Barrett v. US (narrow defendant win → Level 3, arguably correct now)
- Improved from ~84% to ~93%

Key insight: Labels should reflect **systemic impact on government power**, not just who won the specific case.

## Tomorrow: Review ADO-306 Options

**Option 1-3**: Prompt-based QA approaches (cheaper, simpler)
**Option 4**: Agent with example library (more expensive, better judgment)

Decision needed: Which approach for Phase 2 QA?

## Pre-Commit Hook Added

Added reminder hook to `.claude/settings.local.json` - echoes reminder to run code review before commits.

## Files Changed
- `scripts/enrichment/scotus-gpt-prompt.js` - Label-to-outcome alignment section
- `.claude/settings.local.json` - Pre-commit hook
