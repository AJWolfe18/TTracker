# 2026-01-24: ADO-300 Complete - Ready for Prod

**ADO-300** → Ready for Prod

## What Was Done
- Migration 072 applied (clamp_reason, publish_override, facts_model_used, retry_reason)
- gpt-5-mini as primary Pass 1 model with fallback chain: `gpt-5-mini → gpt-4o-mini → gpt-4o`
- Fixed gpt-5-mini API: `max_completion_tokens` instead of `max_tokens`, no `temperature` param
- Fixed false clamp detection (certiorari pattern was matching all SCOTUS cases)
- Code review passed, 3 issues fixed

## Test Results
- Connelly v. United States: enriched with gpt-5-mini, no false clamp, correct label
- Cost: ~$0.004/case with gpt-5-mini (within budget)

## Commits on test branch
- `b0157b1` feat(scotus): ADO-300 clamp/retry/publish override
- `3fac9b1` fix(scotus): use gpt-5-mini as primary
- `d96f223` fix(scotus): gpt-5-mini compatibility + clamp detection fix

## Next Steps
1. Cherry-pick commits to main for PROD deployment
2. Apply migration 072 to PROD DB
3. Run enrichment on PROD to verify Sidestepping rate drops
4. ADO-295 (backfill system) is separate follow-up work
