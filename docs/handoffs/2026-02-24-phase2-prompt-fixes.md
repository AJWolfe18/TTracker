# 2026-02-24 — Phase 2: Prompt Fixes + Re-Eval (ADO-394)

Applied 5 prompt fixes to `scotus-gpt-prompt.js` and `scotus-fact-extraction.js`: severity base-rate guidance, evidence anchors → real quotes, dissent normalization (string "null" → actual null at write layer), issue_area added to Pass 1 output schema, prompt version bumped to `v4-quality-eval`. Re-enriched 10 gold set cases and re-ran eval. String null **fixed entirely** (20%→0%), issue_area null dropped 100%→59%, evidence anchors generic dropped 95%→59%. Blocking rate improved 100%→88% but didn't hit <30% target — remaining issues are D6 (GPT confuses disposition direction in editorial text) and D8 (quote grounding needs fuzzy matching). See `docs/features/ai-evals/plan.md` Session 2 Results for full metrics and Phase 3 candidates.
