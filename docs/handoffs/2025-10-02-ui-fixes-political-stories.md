# Project Handoff - Oct 2, 2025 23:37 - UI Fixes (Political + Stories)

## SESSION SUMMARY
Fixed 3 blocking UI bugs in TEST: Political tab schema mismatch, Story Sources modal empty, and dashboard stats. Political tab now queries `published_at` instead of missing `date` column. Story Sources modal lazy-loads articles via new `fetchStoryArticles()` API. QA can now properly test Stories UI, unblocking TTRC-145.

## WHAT GOT DONE

### Code Changes
**Branch:** test  
**Commit Message:** `fix(ui): resolve political tab schema error and story sources modal`  
**Files Changed:**
- `public/dashboard.js` - Changed 3 queries from `date.desc` to `published_at.desc` (lines 177, 196, 205)
- `public/story-api.js` - Added `fetchStoryArticles()` function with article_story join query
- `public/story-card.js` - Implemented lazy-load pattern, added loading state for sources modal

### Testing Status
- ⏳ **Pending:** Josh needs to test Political tab loads + Story Sources modal populates
- ⏳ **Pending:** Verify no console errors in browser
- ✅ **Verified:** Code changes align with TEST schema (`political_entries.published_at`, `article_story` join)

---

## UPDATES COMPLETED (Via Tools)

### JIRA
- **Updated:** TTRC-184 with implementation details and testing checklist
- **Status:** Remains "In Progress" - awaiting QA verification before moving to Done

### Confluence
- No Confluence updates needed (no architecture or plan changes)

### Documentation
- Created handoff: `/docs/handoffs/2025-10-02-ui-fixes-political-stories.md`
- Updated: `/docs/handoffs/2025-10-02-enrichment-mystery-and-ui-fixes.md` (previous session)

## TECHNICAL CONTEXT

### Key Decisions Made
**Decision:** Lazy-load articles on modal open instead of fetching with every story  
**Rationale:** Reduces initial page load time (84 stories × API calls), improves performance, aligns with "fetch on demand" pattern  
**Alternatives Considered:** 
- Fetch articles with stories initially (rejected: too many API calls)
- Use stories.articles relationship (rejected: doesn't exist in schema)
**Cost Impact:** No cost impact - uses existing Supabase queries

**Decision:** Use `published_at.desc` for political entries sort  
**Rationale:** TEST schema has `published_at` (timestamp), not `date` field  
**Alternatives Considered:** None - this was a schema alignment fix, not a design choice  
**Cost Impact:** No cost impact

### Watch Out For
- **Gotcha:** Story cards show "No summary available" because enrichment handler is commented out (TTRC-148)
- **Gotcha:** `political_entries` table is deprecated (READ-ONLY per schema comment), only has 5 rows in TEST
- **Dependency:** Story enrichment (TTRC-148) must be implemented next to fill 82 blank summaries
- **Risk:** LOW - Changes are schema alignment and standard lazy-load pattern

---

## NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES

### Immediate Actions
1. **Test TTRC-184:** Verify Political tab + Story Sources modal work (15 min testing)
2. **TTRC-148:** Implement story enrichment system (~3-4 hours)
   - Uncomment handler in `job-queue/handlers/story-enrichment.ts`
   - Integrate OpenAI for summary generation
   - Backfill 82 stories missing summaries
   - Budget: ~$15-20 one-time backfill, ~$5/month ongoing
3. **TTRC-145:** After enrichment, Story View will be complete and ready for review

### Blocked/Waiting
- **TTRC-145:** Story View - Blocked by enrichment (stories show blank summaries)
- **Waiting On:** Josh to test TTRC-184 fixes in TEST environment

### Questions for Josh
- **Decision Required:** After testing TTRC-184, confirm we should proceed with enrichment (TTRC-148)
- **Budget Confirmation:** Enrichment will cost ~$15-20 backfill + ~$5/month. This puts us at $40/month total (within $50 limit). Approved?

## ENVIRONMENT STATUS

**TEST Environment:**
- Status: Code changes ready, pending deployment
- URL: https://test--taupe-capybara-0ff2ed.netlify.app/
- Notes: Josh needs to push to trigger Netlify auto-deploy, then test

**PROD Environment:**
- Status: Stable (no changes)
- URL: https://trumpytracker.com/
- Notes: Still running old article system

**Cost:** $35/month (unchanged)

**Database:**
- TEST schema confirmed: `political_entries.published_at` exists (timestamp)
- `article_story` join table working (72 rows)
- `stories` table: 84 active, 82 missing summaries

---

## COMMIT READY

**Commit command for Josh:**
```bash
git add public/dashboard.js public/story-api.js public/story-card.js
git commit -m "fix(ui): resolve political tab schema error and story sources modal

- Changed political_entries queries from date.desc to published_at.desc
- Added fetchStoryArticles() API function for lazy-loading
- Implemented sources modal lazy-load pattern with loading state
- Fixes TTRC-184 (Political tab error + empty sources modal)"
git push origin test
```

**After push:** Wait ~2-3 min for Netlify deploy, then test:
1. Political tab loads without errors
2. Click Story → "View Sources" → Modal shows articles

- [ ] Button shows "Loading..." briefly
- [ ] Modal opens with article list (source name, title, "Read ↗" link)
- [ ] Click "Read ↗" opens article in new tab
- [ ] Close modal and test another story

**Console:**
- [ ] Open browser DevTools → Console tab
