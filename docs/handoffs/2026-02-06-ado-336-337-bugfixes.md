# Handoff: ADO-336/337 Admin Dashboard Bugfixes

**Date:** 2026-02-06
**ADO:** 336, 337
**Branch:** test

Implemented 7 code fixes (8th is manual QA only) from the bugfix plan. Critical: (1) added 6 missing fields to admin-stories SELECT so edit modal has full data, (2) alarm_level now allows 0, (5) pagination uses offset for non-ID sorts. Also removed deprecated severity field from ALLOWED_FIELDS, fixed undo toast dismiss, fixed re-enrich not clearing last_enriched_at, and enrichment script now clears enrichment_status. Edge functions deployed to TEST. **Next:** Manual QA per verification steps in the plan, then deploy to PROD via PR.
