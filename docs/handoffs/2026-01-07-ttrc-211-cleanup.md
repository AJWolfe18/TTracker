**Status:** COMPLETE

---

## Summary

Reviewed and cleaned up all 26 tickets under TTRC-211 "Production Misc Must Do's" epic. Closed obsolete tickets, updated priorities, and clarified scope/dependencies.

---

## What Was Done

### 1. Closed 6 Obsolete Tickets

| Ticket | Summary | Reason |
|--------|---------|--------|
| TTRC-150 | Shadow Run & Metrics Validation | Obsolete - PROD validated through actual usage |
| TTRC-161 | RSS System Production Deployment Checklist | Done - Deployment completed Jan 5-7 |
| TTRC-69 | Cost Tracking & Budget Management | Done - `budgets` table exists |
| TTRC-136 | Cost Control & Budget Management System | Duplicate of TTRC-69 |
| TTRC-146 | API Integration & Error Handling | Done - Frontend API working |
| TTRC-163 | RSS Performance Optimization & Monitoring | Duplicate of TTRC-162 |

### 2. Updated TTRC-139 Scope

Added **Cost/Admin Dashboard** to scope:
- Daily OpenAI spend from `budgets` table
- Running monthly total
- Cost per operation breakdown
- Budget alerts/thresholds visualization

### 3. Documented TTRC-152 Dependency

TTRC-152 (Production Monitoring & Alerts) depends on TTRC-139 (Monitoring & Observability Setup).
- Comment added to TTRC-152 documenting this
- API link creation failed (Jira link types not configured)

### 4. Rescoped TTRC-162

Removed monitoring overlap - now focuses only on RSS-specific performance:
- Parallel Article Processing
- Connection Pooling
- Memory Management
- Circuit Breaker Pattern
- Dead Letter Queue

### 5. Updated Priorities (11 tickets)

| Change | Tickets |
|--------|---------|
| **To High** | TTRC-366 (security) |
| **To Medium** | TTRC-152, TTRC-149 |
| **To Low** | TTRC-363, 364, 154, 138, 153, 165, 168, 42 |

## Final TTRC-211 State

| Priority | Count | Tickets |
|----------|-------|---------|
| **High** | 2 | TTRC-366 (Supabase security), TTRC-139 (monitoring + cost dashboard) |
| **Medium** | 5 | TTRC-152, 70, 149, 162, 336 |
| **Low** | 10 | TTRC-363, 364, 154, 138, 153, 165, 168, 157, 42, 359 |

**Open tickets:** 17 (down from 22)

---

## Key Findings

### Tickets NOT Duplicates (confirmed distinct)
- **TTRC-139** - Backend observability infrastructure (foundation)
- **TTRC-70** - Frontend UX performance (Core Web Vitals, page load)
- **TTRC-152** - Production alerting & ops (depends on 139)
- **TTRC-161** vs **TTRC-162** - 161 was deployment checklist (closed), 162 is ongoing perf work

### QA Tests Available
`npm run qa:*` scripts exist:
- `qa:boundaries` - Clustering edge cases
- `qa:integration` - Article→story attachment
- `qa:idempotency` - Job queue
- `qa:concurrency` - Parallel clustering
- `qa:smoke` - All of the above

---

## Notes

- CLAUDE.md exists on `test` branch (not `main`) - contains project instructions including subagent pattern for Jira
- Atlassian MCP couldn't create issue links (link types not configured in Jira or API lacks permission)
- Cloud ID: `f04decff-2283-43f1-8e60-008935b3d794`
- Transition ID 41 = "Done"
