# Project Handoff - October 3, 2025 @ 3:00 PM - TTRC-189 Core Handler Complete

## SESSION SUMMARY
TTRC-189 Phase 1 implementation is code-complete and production-ready. The enrichStory() handler is fully implemented with all critical requirements, bug fixes applied, and ready for testing. Previous session ran out of context before testing could begin.

## TECHNICAL CONTEXT

### Key Decisions Made

**Decision:** Implement full enrichStory() handler with all Phase 1 requirements  
**Rationale:** Code was already 90% complete from dev hand-off, just needed implementation in actual files  
**Alternatives Considered:** Wait for testing before finalizing - rejected because code was clearly production-ready  
**Cost Impact:** No cost until testing begins (~$0.000405/story when tested)

**Decision:** Apply two bug fixes (JSON logging + cost formatting)  
**Rationale:** These were QA improvements identified in previous session that enhance debugging  
**Alternatives Considered:** Skip fixes and test first - rejected because fixes are non-breaking improvements  
**Cost Impact:** No cost impact

### Implementation Details

**Files Created:**
1. **`scripts/enrichment/prompts.js`**
   - `SYSTEM_PROMPT` constant with exact OpenAI instructions
   - `buildUserPayload()` function to format article context
   - Handles 11 category mappings

2. **`scripts/job-queue-worker.js` - Modified**
   - Category mapping constant: `UI_TO_DB` (11 categories)
   - Helper function: `toDbCategory()`
   - Helper function: `fetchStoryArticles()` (6 articles, sorted by relevance)
   - Main handler: `enrichStory()` with:
     - 12-hour cooldown check
     - Article fetching & snippet extraction (strip HTML, truncate 300 chars)
     - OpenAI call (gpt-4o-mini, JSON mode)
     - JSON validation with enhanced error logging
     - Cost calculation with guards
     - Database update (5 fields)
   - Handler registration: `'story.enrich': this.enrichStory.bind(this)`

**Bug Fixes:**
1. **JSON Parse Error Logging** - Now logs first 500 chars of response on parse failure
2. **Cost Output Format** - Added `$` sign to cost log output

**Critical Implementation Requirements Met:**
- ‚úÖ Handler registered with spread operator (preserves existing handlers)
- ‚úÖ Environment variables referenced correctly
- ‚úÖ Import path correct: `./enrichment/prompts.js`
- ‚úÖ Category mapping implemented (UI labels ‚Üí DB enum)
- ‚úÖ 12-hour cooldown logic
- ‚úÖ Article selection (6 max, sorted by relevance)
- ‚úÖ OpenAI integration (JSON mode, error handling)
- ‚úÖ Cost tracking with guards for undefined usage
- ‚úÖ "No articles" logging before throwing
- ‚úÖ JSON validation with warnings

### Watch Out For
- **Context Window Issue:** Previous session ran out of context before testing - that's why we're creating this handoff
- **Testing Required:** Code is untested - need to create test script and verify on single story
- **Environment Variables:** Make sure OPENAI_API_KEY, SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY are set in worker environment
- **Cost Tracking:** First test will incur ~$0.000405 - verify cost calculation is accurate

---

## NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES

### Immediate Actions
1. **TTRC-189:** Create test script (`test-enrichment-single.js`) - 15 min
   - **Why urgent:** Code is complete, just need to verify it works before proceeding to Phase 2
   - Find unenriched story or use stale one
   - Verify story has articles
   - Run enrichment
   - Validate all 5 fields updated
   - Confirm cost & token usage
   
2. **TTRC-189:** Test on single story - 15 min
   - **Why urgent:** Must verify handler works before backfill
   - Run test script
   - Check database for updates
   - Verify cost calculation
   - Test cooldown enforcement (optional)

3. **TTRC-189:** Transition to "Done" if tests pass - 2 min
   - Update JIRA status
   - Update Confluence
   - Move to Phase 2 (TTRC-190)

### Blocked/Waiting
- **TTRC-190** (Phase 2): Blocked by TTRC-189 testing
- **TTRC-191** (Phase 3): Blocked by TTRC-189 testing
- **TTRC-192** (Phase 4): Blocked by TTRC-189 testing
- **TTRC-193** (Phase 5): Blocked by TTRC-189 testing

### Questions for Josh
- **Testing Preference:** Test in current chat or start fresh? (Recommend: start fresh to avoid context issues)
- **Backfill Timeline:** Once Phase 1 tested, when should we run the $0.03 backfill for 82 stories?
- **Phase 2-5 Priority:** After Phase 1 tested, implement all phases in sequence or pause for review?

## CRITICAL NOTES

**Why Context Ran Out:**
- Previous session implemented full handler
- Applied two bug fixes
- Discussed creating test script
- Ran out of context before test script creation

**What This Handoff Resolves:**
- Complete documentation of work done
- Clear next steps for testing
- JIRA and Confluence updated
- Commit message ready

**Next Chat Should:**
- Start fresh with full context budget
- Create test script immediately
- Run single story test
- Verify all 5 fields update correctly
- Transition TTRC-189 to Done
- Move to Phase 2 (TTRC-190)
