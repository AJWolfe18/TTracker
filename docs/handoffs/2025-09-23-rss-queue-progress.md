# Project Handoff - 2025-09-23 2100 - RSS Job Queue Implementation

**SESSION SUMMARY:**
Fixed critical RSS job queue infrastructure issues - worker now runs successfully with atomic claiming preventing race conditions, though fetch jobs still fail due to column naming issue.

**BRANCH & COMMITS:**
- Working Branch: test
- Commit: "fix: Complete RSS job queue implementation with atomic claiming"
- Files Changed:
  - `.github/workflows/rss-e2e-test.yml`
  - `scripts/job-queue-worker-atomic.js`
  - `scripts/run-worker.js`
  - `scripts/seed-feeds-ci.js`
  - `scripts/seed-fetch-jobs.js`
  - `scripts/verify-atomic-rpcs.js`
  - `scripts/verify-e2e-results.js`
  - `migrations/008_job_queue_critical_columns.sql`
  - `migrations/009_atomic_job_claiming.sql`

**STATUS:**
✅ Verified:
- Atomic job claiming works (SKIP LOCKED prevents race conditions)
- Worker runs and claims jobs successfully
- CI/CD workflow executes without crashing
- Database has correct status values ('done' not 'completed')
- 31 jobs ready to process in TEST environment

⚠️ Pending:
- Fix `feed_registry.url` → `feed_url` column name issue
- Fix story.cluster jobs missing `article_id` in payload

❌ Issues:
- All fetch_feed jobs fail: "column feed_registry.url does not exist"
- All story.cluster jobs fail: "Cannot destructure property 'article_id'"

**JIRA UPDATES COMPLETED:**
- No transitions made (TTRC-141 Article Processing Pipeline still To Do)
- TTRC-44 RSS & Social Feed Integration identified as relevant

**DOCS UPDATED:**
- Codebase: Created multiple handoff docs (can be cleaned up)
- No Confluence updates made

**KEY DECISIONS:**
- Used atomic claiming with SKIP LOCKED instead of advisory locks (simpler, more reliable)
- Kept 'done' status value instead of 'completed' (aligns with new schema)
- Simplified CI workflow to avoid complex error handling

**NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES:**
1. Fix column name: `feed_registry.url` → `feed_url` in fetch handler
2. Fix story.cluster payload structure to include `article_id`
3. Run full E2E test to verify articles are created

**CRITICAL NOTES:**
- Environment: TEST database ready, atomic functions installed
- Cost Impact: No change (within $50/month target)
- Blockers: Column naming mismatch preventing RSS fetching
- PM Decision Needed: None - technical fixes only
