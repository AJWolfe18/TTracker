# Executive Orders Enrichment System - Implementation Plan

**Epic:** TTRC-16 (Executive Orders Tracker)  
**Created:** October 10, 2025  
**Status:** Planning  
**Owner:** Josh Wolfe  
**Budget:** $50/month (total project), ~$0.21 one-time + ~$0.01/month ongoing

---

## Executive Summary

Transform the Executive Orders tracking system from basic metadata collection into a comprehensive analysis platform using the 4-part editorial framework (TTRC-61 original vision). This provides "What They Say" vs "What It Actually Means" analysis with fact-checking and action recommendations.

**Key Benefits:**
- Deep editorial analysis cutting through political spin
- Actionable recommendations (direct actions, systemic change, or tracking)
- Enhanced metadata (regions, policy areas, affected agencies)
- Separate dedicated section (not mixed with stories)
- Negligible cost impact (~$0.01/month ongoing)

---

## System Overview

### Current State
- ~190 executive orders collected from Federal Register API
- Basic metadata: title, date, summary, category
- 10 ad-hoc categories
- No deep analysis or action framework
- Daily collection working (11 AM EST)

### Target State
- Same collection pipeline + enrichment
- 4-part editorial analysis per EO
- Action framework with tiered recommendations
- 12-category policy-focused system
- Dedicated `/executive-orders` route with filters
- Enhanced metadata (regions, agencies, policy areas)

---

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- OpenAI API (gpt-4o-mini)
- Federal Register API (already working)
- Supabase database (TEST and PROD)

### Internal Dependencies
```
TTRC-216 (schema) 
  ↓
TTRC-217 (prompt) & TTRC-218 (worker)
  ↓
TTRC-219 (backfill)
  ↓
TTRC-220 (page) & TTRC-221 (card) [can parallel]
  ↓
TTRC-222 (filters)
  ↓
TTRC-223 (integration) & TTRC-224 (nav) [can parallel]
```

### Blockers

## Cost Analysis

### One-Time Costs
| Item | Quantity | Unit Cost | Total |
|------|----------|-----------|-------|
| Backfill enrichment | 190 EOs | $0.0011 | $0.21 |
| Testing/QA enrichments | ~20 EOs | $0.0011 | $0.02 |
| **One-time Total** | | | **$0.23** |

### Ongoing Monthly Costs
| Item | Quantity | Unit Cost | Total |
|------|----------|-----------|-------|
| New EO enrichment | ~8-10 EOs | $0.0011 | $0.01 |
| Re-enrichment (if needed) | ~1-2 EOs | $0.0011 | $0.002 |
| **Monthly Total** | | | **~$0.01** |

### Annual Projection
- **Year 1:** $0.23 (one-time) + $0.12 (12 months) = **$0.35**
- **Year 2+:** $0.12/year

### Budget Impact
- Current budget: $50/month
- New EO cost: $0.01/month (0.02% of budget)
- **Impact: Negligible**

---

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Technical Risks

#### Risk: OpenAI API failures during backfill
**Impact:** High - Could block enrichment of all EOs  
**Likelihood:** Medium  
**Mitigation:**
- Implement retry logic (1 immediate retry)
- Process in small batches (5 EOs)
- Log failures and continue
- Can re-run failed EOs manually
- Consider rate limiting (2s between batches)

#### Risk: Poor enrichment quality
**Impact:** High - Bad UX, misleading info  
**Likelihood:** Medium  
**Mitigation:**
- Sample test 5 EOs before full backfill
- Manual QA review of 10 random EOs
- Adjust prompt based on results
- Can re-enrich with improved prompt
- Track action_confidence scores

#### Risk: Database schema changes break collection
**Impact:** Critical - Stops daily EO tracking  
**Likelihood:** Low  
**Mitigation:**
- Backward compatible schema (all new fields nullable)
- Test collection script after schema changes
- Keep legacy fields during transition
- Rollback plan documented

#### Risk: Performance issues with 190 EOs
**Impact:** Medium - Slow page load  
**Likelihood:** Low  
**Mitigation:**
- Pagination (20 EOs per page)
- Database indexes on key fields
- Lazy loading for expanded cards
- Cache filter options (5 min TTL)

---

### Business Risks

#### Risk: User confusion with separate EO section
**Impact:** Medium - Lower engagement  
**Likelihood:** Low  
**Mitigation:**
- Clear navigation labels
- Prominent placement in main nav
- Onboarding tooltips (optional)
- Similar UI patterns to stories

#### Risk: Cost overrun if enrichment needs re-runs
**Impact:** Low - Still well under budget  
**Likelihood:** Medium  
**Mitigation:**
- Track costs per enrichment
- Set alerts for >$1/month spend
- Hard limit: only enrich once per EO
- Manual approval for re-enrichment batches

---

### Operational Risks

#### Risk: Daily job times out with enrichment
**Impact:** Medium - Missing new EOs  
**Likelihood:** Low  
**Mitigation:**
- Increase timeout from 10min to 15min
- Sequential processing (not parallel)
- Monitor job duration
- Alert on failures
- Fallback: run enrichment separately

#### Risk: Missing enrichment on new EOs
**Impact:** Low - Can backfill later  
**Likelihood:** Medium  
**Mitigation:**
- Query for `enriched_at IS NULL` periodically
- Manual enrichment script available
- Monitor enriched_at field
- Alert if >5 unenriched EOs

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
**Scope:** Individual functions  
**Coverage:**
- `enrichExecutiveOrder()` with mock OpenAI responses
- `buildEOPayload()` with various EO formats
- Query builders for filters
- Action tier validation logic

**Tools:** Jest, React Testing Library

---

### Integration Testing
**Scope:** End-to-end workflows  
**Test Cases:**
1. **Collection + Enrichment:** 
   - Trigger collection manually
   - Verify new EO saved
   - Verify enrichment ran
   - Check all fields populated
   
2. **Page Load + Filters:**
   - Load `/executive-orders`
   - Apply multiple filters
   - Verify correct results
   - Check URL params

3. **Card Expand/Collapse:**
   - Expand EO card
   - Verify 4 sections display
   - Check action section conditional
   - Collapse card

**Tools:** Playwright, Cypress (optional)

---

### QA Validation

#### Sample Testing (Before Full Backfill)
**Test 5 representative EOs:**
1. Immigration/border (high stakes)
2. Environmental rollback (technical)
3. Economic/trade (affects businesses)
4. Ceremonial/symbolic (low action tier)
5. National security (classified info handling)

**Check for:**
- All 4 sections populated and coherent
- Action tiers appropriate
- No hallucinated URLs
- Categories correct
- Specificity scores make sense

#### Production Spot Checks (After Backfill)
**Sample 10 random enriched EOs:**
- 3 critical severity
- 4 moderate/severe
- 3 minor
- Verify quality across severity levels

**Quality Metrics:**
- 90%+ have all 4 sections >100 words
- 70%+ have Tier 1 or Tier 2 actions
- 0% have fabricated URLs
- 95%+ have correct categories

---

### User Acceptance Testing
**Test Scenarios:**
1. **Browse all EOs:** Load page, scroll, pagination works
2. **Filter by category:** Select 2 categories, verify results
3. **Search by order number:** Search "14145", verify result
4. **Expand EO:** Read 4-part analysis, check actions
5. **Click action:** Action URL opens correctly
6. **Mobile experience:** Test on phone, filters work

**Success Criteria:**
- All workflows complete without errors
- Page loads <3 seconds
- Filters respond <1 second
- Mobile usable (no horizontal scroll)

## Rollback Plan

### If Enrichment Quality Is Poor
**Trigger:** <80% of EOs have acceptable quality

**Actions:**
1. Stop automatic enrichment (disable in TTRC-223)
2. Clear enrichment fields:
   ```sql
   UPDATE executive_orders 
   SET section_what_they_say = NULL,
       section_what_it_means = NULL,
       section_reality_check = NULL,
       section_why_it_matters = NULL,
       action_tier = NULL,
       action_section = NULL,
       enriched_at = NULL
   WHERE enriched_at IS NOT NULL;
   ```
3. Refine prompt (TTRC-217)
4. Re-test with 5 sample EOs
5. If passing, re-run backfill

**Time to Rollback:** 1 hour

---

### If Daily Job Fails Repeatedly
**Trigger:** >3 consecutive daily job failures

**Actions:**
1. Disable automatic enrichment
2. Collection continues (enrichment optional)
3. Debug enrichment worker
4. Fix and test locally
5. Re-enable when stable

**Impact:** New EOs collected but not enriched (can backfill later)

**Time to Rollback:** Immediate (comment out enrichment call)

---

### If Frontend Has Critical Bugs
**Trigger:** User-facing errors, page won't load

**Actions:**
1. Revert frontend deployment
2. Remove navigation link (TTRC-224)
3. Fix bugs in TEST
4. Re-test thoroughly
5. Re-deploy when stable

**Impact:** EO section temporarily unavailable (backend still working)

**Time to Rollback:** 30 minutes

---

### If Costs Exceed Budget
**Trigger:** OpenAI costs >$0.50/month

**Actions:**
1. Investigate spike (API usage logs)
2. Disable automatic enrichment if needed
3. Set hard limits in code (max 10 enrichments/day)
4. Review prompt length (reduce tokens)
5. Consider cheaper model (gpt-3.5-turbo)

**Likelihood:** Very low (current estimate $0.01/month)

---
