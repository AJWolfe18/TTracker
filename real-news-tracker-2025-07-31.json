Section 1983 for alleged Medicaid Act violations. The Court found the Act\\'s \\'any qualified provider\\' provision lacks explicit \\'rights-creating language\\' necessary for a private right of action, reducing judicial enforcement options and increasing reliance on federal oversight. This decision has significant implications for reproductive healthcare providers and enrollees, especially following the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which limits federal Medicaid funding to organizations associated with abortion services. States now have broader authority to exclude providers like Planned Parenthood from their Medicaid programs, potentially reducing access to essential healthcare services, particularly in underserved areas.",
