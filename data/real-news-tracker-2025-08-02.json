    "description": "A Washington, D.C., attorney disciplinary panel has recommended disbarment for Jeffrey Clark, a former senior Justice Department official under President Donald Trump, for his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. The panel found that Clark was willing to have the Justice Department falsely claim it had found significant issues with the election results, particularly in Georgia, where he proposed sending a misleading letter to state officials urging them to consider overturning the results. The majority on the nine-member D.C. Board on Professional Responsibility ruled that Clark violated fundamental legal ethics by advocating based on falsehoods. The final decision rests with the D.C. Court of Appeals. While White House Office of Management and Budget spokesperson Rachel Cauley defended Clark as a victim of political targeting, others pointed to serious breaches of legal conduct. A previous panel recommended a two-year suspension, and two board members advocated a three-year suspension instead of disbarment. Clark has denied any wrongdoing.",
