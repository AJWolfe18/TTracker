# Migration 022 - Improvements Applied

Based on expert SQL review feedback, the following improvements were made to Migration 022:

## ✅ Changes Applied

### 1. NULL-Safe Lifecycle Updater
**Problem**: Function assumed `last_updated_at` exists and NULL comparisons would fail
**Fix**: Added COALESCE fallback chain and IS DISTINCT FROM for proper NULL handling

```sql
COALESCE(
  last_updated_at,
  upper(time_range),
  first_seen_at,
  NOW() - INTERVAL '999 years'  -- extreme fallback
)
```

### 2. JSONB Index Operator Class
**Problem**: `jsonb_path_ops` limited to containment queries only
**Fix**: Switched to default `jsonb_ops` for flexibility (supports more operators)

```sql
-- Changed from: jsonb_path_ops
-- Changed to:   default (supports all jsonb operators)
CREATE INDEX ... ON articles USING gin (entities);
```

### 3. Added Missing Helpful Indexes

**Quote hashes** (for shared quote detection):
```sql
CREATE INDEX ix_articles_quote_hashes_gin
  ON articles USING gin (quote_hashes);
```

**Geography lookups**:
```sql
CREATE INDEX ix_articles_geo_state
  ON articles ((geo->>'state'));

CREATE INDEX ix_articles_geo_country
  ON articles ((geo->>'country'));
```

### 4. CONCURRENTLY for Locks
**Problem**: GIN indexes can block writes during build
**Fix**: Added CONCURRENTLY for non-HNSW indexes

```sql
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS ix_articles_keyphrases_gin ...
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS ix_articles_url_canonical ...
```

**Note**: HNSW doesn't support CONCURRENTLY yet, kept as-is

### 5. Lightweight Foreign Keys
**Problem**: No referential integrity, but don't want deletes to fail
**Fix**: Added nullable FKs with SET NULL + DEFERRABLE

```sql
ALTER TABLE openai_usage
  ADD CONSTRAINT openai_usage_article_fk
    FOREIGN KEY (article_id) REFERENCES articles(id)
    ON DELETE SET NULL DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED;
```

### 6. Embedding Dimension Guards
**Problem**: No validation that embeddings match expected dimensions
**Fix**: Added CHECK constraints for vector dimensions

```sql
ALTER TABLE articles
  ADD CONSTRAINT articles_embedding_v1_dim_chk
  CHECK (embedding_v1 IS NULL OR vector_dims(embedding_v1) = 1536) NOT VALID;
```

### 7. Entities Array Validation
**Problem**: No shape validation for entities jsonb
**Fix**: Added CHECK constraint

```sql
ALTER TABLE articles
  ADD CONSTRAINT entities_is_array_chk
  CHECK (jsonb_typeof(entities) = 'array') NOT VALID;
```

### 8. Enum Type for Operations
**Problem**: Free-text operation column prone to typos
**Fix**: Created proper enum type

```sql
CREATE TYPE openai_op AS ENUM ('entity_extraction', 'embedding', 'quote_extraction');

ALTER TABLE openai_usage
  ALTER COLUMN operation TYPE openai_op;
```

### 9. Additional Constraints
**Lifecycle state**:
```sql
ALTER TABLE stories
  ADD CONSTRAINT stories_lifecycle_state_chk
  CHECK (lifecycle_state IN ('emerging', 'growing', 'stable', 'stale')) NOT VALID;
```

**Thresholds profile**:
```sql
ALTER TABLE stories
  ADD CONSTRAINT stories_thresholds_profile_chk
  CHECK (thresholds_profile IN ('wire', 'opinion', 'policy')) NOT VALID;
```

## Summary of Benefits

✅ **NULL-safe**: No silent failures from NULL comparisons
✅ **Flexible**: Default JSONB ops support all query patterns
✅ **Fast lookups**: Added missing indexes for hot paths
✅ **Low lock contention**: CONCURRENTLY for large indexes
✅ **Data integrity**: FKs, CHECKs, and enum types
✅ **Future-proof**: Dimension guards prevent model mix-ups
✅ **Safe constraints**: All use NOT VALID to avoid locking

## Testing Recommendations

After applying, verify:

```sql
-- 1. Check indexes created
SELECT indexname FROM pg_indexes
WHERE tablename IN ('articles', 'stories')
ORDER BY tablename, indexname;

-- 2. Check constraints
SELECT conname, contype FROM pg_constraint
WHERE conrelid IN ('articles'::regclass, 'stories'::regclass, 'openai_usage'::regclass);

-- 3. Check enum type
SELECT enumlabel FROM pg_enum
WHERE enumtypid = 'openai_op'::regtype;

-- 4. Test lifecycle update (should not error on NULLs)
SELECT update_story_lifecycle_states();
```
