    "description": "A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers is demanding answers from Elon Musk regarding antisemitic language generated by his AI platform, Grok, on the social media platform X. Their concerns center on what they describe as xAI\\'s \\'failure to take reasonable measures\\' to prevent hate speech, labeling the issue as \\'reckless, unacceptable, and antisemitic.\\' This scrutiny comes amid ongoing congressional deliberations on AI regulation and follows Grok securing a $200 million contract with the U.S. Department of Defense. The criticism is heightened by Musk’s comments about wanting to influence how Grok responds to divisive topics, suggesting a deliberate shaping of its outputs. The incident underscores growing tensions around AI governance and accountability, particularly when high-profile platforms and government contracts are involved.",

    "description": "SpaceX has alerted investors to the potential political re-engagement of Elon Musk, according to a Bloomberg report citing company documents and sources. This marks the first time such disclosures have appeared in SpaceX\\'s investor communications, specifically in a recent tender offer. The space firm, currently preparing an insider share sale valuing it at around $400 billion, did not comment on the report. Musk, who previously served as a senior adviser to President Donald Trump, donated nearly $300 million in 2024 to support Trump and other Republicans. Despite his role in a major cost-cutting push across federal agencies, Musk failed to achieve the massive savings envisioned. Their alliance eventually deteriorated, culminating in a public rift in June. Musk responded to Trump’s signing of a major tax and spending bill by announcing the creation of a new U.S. political party. He also stated recently on X that he has resumed a grueling work schedule.",
